Description: An implementation for testing the homogeneity of covariance 
    matrices in high-dimensional longitudinal data with temporospatial 
    dependence. The null hypothesis is that all covariance matrices are equal 
    at each time point. If the null hypothesis is rejected, estimates of the 
    change points are provided. A binary segmentation approach is applied to 
    estimate multiple change points.
