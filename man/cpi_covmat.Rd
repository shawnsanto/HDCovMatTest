\title{Estimate multiple change points among high-dimensional covariance matrices}
\usage{
cpi_covmat(y, n, p, TT, alpha = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A high-dimensional longitudinal data set in the format of a three
dimensional array where the first coordinate is for features, the second
coordinate is for sample subjects, and the third coordinate is for time
repetitions. Thus, the dimension of y is \eqn{p x n x TT} where
\eqn{p} is the data dimension, \eqn{n} is the sample size, and \eqn{TT}
is the number of repetition times.}

\item{n}{The number of individuals.}

\item{p}{The data dimension.}

\item{TT}{The number of repetition times. It is recommended that
\eqn{TT \le 30} so the asymptotics in Zhong, Li, and Santo (2019)
can be applied.}

\item{alpha}{The type I error of the homogeniety test. The nominal level for
the quantile is computed as \eqn{1-alpha}. Suggested values for alpha
include 0.01 (default) and 0.05.}
}
\value{
The function returns the estimated chane point(s), corresponding
    test statistic value(s), corresponding p-value(s), and a table that
    provides an identification for which time points have a homogeneous
    covariance structure. The output is a list.
  \describe{
    \item{$change_points}{The estimated change points. Order is based
      on the algorithm's binary segmentation approach.}
    \item{$teststats}{The test statistic(s) corresponding to the estimated
      change point(s).}
    \item{$pvalues}{The p-value(s) corresponding to the estimated
      change point(s).}
    \item{$covariance_id}{A table that indicates which covariance matrices
      are homogeneous given the estimated change point(s). For example, when
      TT = 5, a single change point identified at time 3 implies the
      covariance matrices for times 1, 2, and 3 are equal, but they are
      different from the covariance matrices that are equal at time points
      4 and 5.}
    \item{$note}{A comment that explains $covariance_id.}
      }
}
\description{
This function estimates multiple change points among covariance
matrices for high-dimensional longitudinal data. The change points are
identified using the testing procedure and binary segmentation approach
proposed in Zhong, Li, and Santo (2019).The methodology has been proved,
tested, and shown to work well for high-dimensional longtidudinal data where
both \eqn{p} and \eqn{n} diverge, but no explicit relationship between
\eqn{p} and \eqn{n} is needed. Furthermore, the current methodology works for
longitudinal data with a small number of repetition times, i.e.,
\eqn{TT < \infty}.
